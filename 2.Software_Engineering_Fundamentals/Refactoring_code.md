Refactoring Code
---
---

* **REFACTORING**: restructuring your code to improve its internal structure, without changing its external functionality. This gives you a chance to clean and modularize your program after you've got it working.

* Since it isn't easy to write your best code while you're still trying to just get it working, allocating time to do this is essential to producing high quality code. Despite the initial time and effort required, this really pays off by speeding up your development time in the long run.

* You become a much stronger programmer when you're constantly looking to improve your code. The more you refactor, the easier it will be to structure and write good code the first time.
