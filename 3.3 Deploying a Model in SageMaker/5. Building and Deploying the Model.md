Remember to shutdown your endpoint, if you are not going to use it for a while; we'll remind you again at the end of this video.

To begin with, we are going to extend the mini-project that you worked on in the last lesson by deploying it. There are a couple of changes made to the way that data is processed in this version and the reason for this is to simplify some of what follows.

For the most part, however, we simply add on an extra deployment step to the sentiment analysis mini-project and then test that our deployed endpoint is working correctly.

Once this is done we know that we have a sentiment analysis model that has been trained, is performing well and is working, a great place to start!

**Don't forget to SHUT DOWN your endpoint!**
