Using the Final Web Application

Now we get to reap the rewards of all our hard work, we get to deploy our web app!

The back end of our app has been set up so at this point all we need to do is finish up the user facing portion, the website itself. To do this we just need to tell our website where it should send data to.

Don't forget!

In order for our web app to work, we need to have our model deployed. This means that we are incurring a cost. So, once you have finished playing with your newly created web app, make sure to shut it down!

You may also want to clean up the endpoint that you constructed and the Lambda function. This isn't too important, however, since each of these services only incur a cost when used.

**Some notes on Lambda and Gateway usage**
For Lambda functions you are only charged per execution, which for this class will be very few and still within the free tier. Deleting a lambda function is just a good cleanup step; you won't be charged if you just leave it there (without executing it). Similarly, for APIs created using API Gateway you are only charged per request, and the number of requests we require in this course should still fall under the free tier.
