In this mini-project we will take a look at situation in which we have a trained model which is working well, but then something changes with the underlying distribution on which our model is based. First we need to take a look at what might be the problem. Then we want to create a new, updated model and replace our old model without taking down the corresponding endpoint.

This mini-project notebook is called `IMDB Sentiment Analysis - XGBoost (Updating a Model).ipynb` and can be found inside of the Mini-Projects folder.
