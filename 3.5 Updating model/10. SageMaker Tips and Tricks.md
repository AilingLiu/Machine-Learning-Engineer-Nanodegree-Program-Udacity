* check the output of the training jobs on cloudwatch
   * Amazon SageMaker - Training - Training jobs - click on the training job you want to investigate - scroll down to find Monitor - View logs

* don't be afraid of copy and paste because generally the change between models are very small

* the documentation on sagemaker may not be as fast updated as the sagemaker itself. check out their [github repo](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/tree/master/src/sagemaker) to see details directly.

* make sure the naming object on sagemaker is unique
