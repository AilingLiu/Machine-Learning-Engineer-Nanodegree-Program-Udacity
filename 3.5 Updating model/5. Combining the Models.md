Combining the Models

Using the low level approach to creating endpoint configurations allows us to create endpoints that are more sophisticated. For example, endpoints which receive data and route that data to one of many different models. In the example here we are only using two different models but there may be situations in which you would want more.

In addition, SageMaker provides functionality to update an existing endpoint so that it conforms to a different endpoint configuration. Further, SageMaker does this in a way that does not require the existing endpoint to be shut down.

This is very beneficial as you may be working in an environment where there are other services that depend on your deployed endpoint.
