Expert Interview: AWS SageMaker
In these exclusive interview segments, learn about SageMaker and how it is applied to real-world use cases. One of the values that SageMaker and Udacity share is that they want to make machine learning accessible. We do this through education, and they do it through making tools and scalable infrastructure available to learners and engineers.

Later in this course, you'll learn about how SageMaker has developed over time and hear some predictions about the future of ML-powered technology.
