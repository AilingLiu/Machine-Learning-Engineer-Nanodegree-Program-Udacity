Use unsupervised learning when your end goal is simple, in which you don't need details of each individual;

Supervised learning needs more details of each labeled individual;

Data labeling tasks can be done by:
* manually label
* active learning model

How Sagemaker reduces manual labeling efforts:

* Uses a combination of human labelers and an active learning model to efficiently label data;
* Reduces the time and cost to label datasets by about 70%.
