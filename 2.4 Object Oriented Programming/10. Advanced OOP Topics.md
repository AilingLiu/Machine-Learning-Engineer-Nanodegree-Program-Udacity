Advanced OOP Topics

Inheritance is the last object-oriented programming topic in the lesson. Thus far you've been exposed to:

* classes and objects
* attributes and methods
* magic methods
* inheritance

Classes, object, attributes, methods, and inheritance are common to all object-oriented programming languages.

Knowing these topics is enough to start writing object-oriented software. What you've learned so far is all you need to know to complete this OOP lesson. However, these are only the fundamentals of object-oriented programming.

Here is a list of resources for advanced Python object-oriented programming topics.

* [class methods, instance methods, and static methods](https://realpython.com/instance-class-and-static-methods-demystified/) - these are different types of methods that can be accessed at the class or object level
* [class attributes vs instance attributes](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_class_and_instance_attributes.php) - you can also define attributes at the class level or at the instance level
* [multiple inheritance, mixins](https://easyaspython.com/mixins-for-fun-and-profit-cb9962760556) - A class can inherit from multiple parent classes
* [Python decorators](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/) - Decorators are a short-hand way for using functions inside other functions
