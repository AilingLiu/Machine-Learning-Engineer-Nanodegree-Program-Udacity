**Function vs Method**

A function and a method look very similar. They both use the `def` keyword. They also have inputs and return outputs. The difference is that a method is inside of a class whereas a function is outside of a class.


What is self?

If you instantiate two objects, how does Python differentiate between these two objects?

```
shirt_one = Shirt('red', 'S', 'short-sleeve', 15)
short_two = Shirt('yellow', 'M', 'long-sleeve', 20)
```

That's where `self` comes into play. If you call the `change_price` method on shirt_one, how does Python know to change the price of shirt_one and not of shirt_two?

```
shirt_one.change_price(12)
```

Behind the scenes, Python is calling the `change_price` method:

```
    def change_price(self, new_price):

        self.price = new_price
```

`Self` tells Python where to look in the computer's memory for the shirt_one object. And then Python changes the price of the shirt_one object. When you call the `change_price` method, `shirt_one.change_price(12)`, `self` is implicitly passed in.

The word `self` is just a convention. You could actually use any other name as long as you are consistent; however, you should always use `self` rather than some other word or else you might confuse people.
