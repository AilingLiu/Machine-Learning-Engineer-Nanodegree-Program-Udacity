If you are having trouble uploading your package to PyPi, here are a few issues that other students have faced.

PyPi vs. Test PyPi
Note that pypi.org and test.pypy.org are two different websites. You'll need to register separately at each website. If you only register at pypi.org, you will not be able to upload to the test.pypy.org repository.

Unique Name
Remember that your package name must be unique. If you use a package name that is already taken, you will get an error when trying to upload the package.

Re-uploading and Versioning
Once you upload your package to PyPi, you cannot upload the same version again. All that means is that you need to go into your setup.py file and change the version number. For example, if you uploaded a package with `version = 0.1.1`, then you'll need to change this to something else like `version = 0.1.2`.

If you've ever wondered what all these version numbers mean, here is a tutorial about [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Semantic versioning is a standard for deciding when to move up to the next number in your versioning scheme.
