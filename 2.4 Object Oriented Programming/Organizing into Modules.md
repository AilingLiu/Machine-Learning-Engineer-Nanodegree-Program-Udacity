Windows vs. macOS vs. Linux
---
Linux, which our Udacity classroom workspaces use, is an operating system like Windows or macOS. One important difference is that Linux is free and open source whereas Windows is owned by Microsoft and macOS by Apple.

Throughout the lesson, you can do all of your work in a classroom workspace. These workspaces provide interfaces that connect to [virtual machines in the cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/launch-a-virtual-machine/). However, if you want to run this code locally on your computer, the commands to use might be slightly different.

If you are using macOS, you can open an application called "Terminal" and essentially use the same commands that you use in the workspace. That is because [Linux and MacOS are related](https://www.quora.com/Is-macOS-essentially-built-on-top-of-Linux).

If you are using Windows, the analogous application is called console. The console commands can be somewhat different than the terminal commands. A search engine like Google is your best friend for finding the right commands in a Windows environment.

The classroom workspace has one major benefit. You can do whatever you want to the workspace including installing Python packages. And if something goes wrong, you can reset the workspace and start with a clean slate; however, always download your code files or commit your code to github or gitlab before resetting a workspace. Otherwise, you will lose your code!
