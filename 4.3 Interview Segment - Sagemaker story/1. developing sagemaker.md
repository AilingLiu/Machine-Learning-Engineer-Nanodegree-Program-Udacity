* our mission is to put Machine Learning in the hands of every developer
* to do this, we put the ml, dl framework available
* so data scientist, research scientist, etc. will be able to play around it naturally
* we build a lot of automation on infrastructure, and bring the most common and popular algorithms into sagemaker, and optimize them for large scale, large datasets
* we put a lot of examples of these algorithms to ease the frictions of first entry
* it started as small project, and people contribute it and it grows as what it is now


**What are some use cases that work well (or don't) with SageMaker?**
