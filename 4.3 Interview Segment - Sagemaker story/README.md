**How does AWS decide which features to add to their cloud services?**

* listen to customers, work with customers and work backwards on what they need
* listen to market, listen to customers internally and externally
* the roadmap of building product is based on these customer requirements

**What is the goal behind the SageMaker [example repository](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples)?**
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk9ChDtv_nQ)

* our mission is to put Machine Learning in the hands of every developer
* to do this, we put the ml, dl framework available
* so data scientist, research scientist, etc. will be able to play around it naturally
* we build a lot of automation on infrastructure, and bring the most common and popular algorithms into sagemaker, and optimize them for large scale, large datasets
* we put a lot of examples of these algorithms to ease the frictions of first entry
* it started as small project, and people contribute it and it grows as what it is now


**What are some use cases that work well (or don't) with SageMaker?**

* sagemaker has a usage for everyone
* iso, gdpr... all the compliance are integrated in SageMaker
* sagemaker has jupyter notebook and GPU for udacity students to use

**How do you label data at scale?**

* if you have lots of images, first manually label a small datasets, then let your ml model to learn how to label the rest in the future. This method is called active learning.
* 70% of savings can be generated for customer by using SageMaker groundtruth

**What predictions do you have for the future of this technology? What features might be prioritized in the next few years?**
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=git73JsQC1Y)

* from customer needs to products made
* heavily investing into the 'end to end' lifecycle
* deploy model: have real time end point web app; use for batch processing; most popular, get ml model close to users as much as possible
* some building ideas: put energy on compiling a complex heavy model into a light-weight model where you can fit it into small devices

**Do you have advice for someone who wants to become an ML engineer?**
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgq4eukacqE)

* stay hungry, stay fool
* follow the key influencers, know their research interests
* keep learning courses, you get knowledge and also keep up with the market trends. Find your interests among these to focus and develop.
* work with online tool, documentations (such as sagemaker repo), courses, etc. to learn correctly, and fast
