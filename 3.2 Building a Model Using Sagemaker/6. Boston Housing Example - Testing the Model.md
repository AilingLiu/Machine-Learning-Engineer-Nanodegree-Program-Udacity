You can read more about the transform and wait functions, in the [transformer documentation](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transformer.html). In this case, the transformer is used to create a transform job and evaluate a trained model. The transform function takes in the location of some test data, and some information about how that test data is formatted.
