Getting the Notebooks
---

Recently, SageMaker has added a line in the setup code to link directly to a Github repository and it's recommended that you use that setup!

Also on the `Actions` list, you should select `Open Jupyter` to get to the examples notebooks. from the dropdown menu, you'll still be able to see the `Stop` action.

Now that your notebook instance has been set up and is running, it's time to get the notebooks that we will be using during this module.

These notebooks are stored in a [repository on Github](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment) and the easiest way to make them available inside of your notebook instance is to use git and clone the repository.

The video below goes through this process. Also, if you would prefer to read the instructions, these have been provided and can be found underneath the video.

Cloning the Deployment Notebooks
---

In order to clone the deployment repository into your notebook instance, click on the new drop down menu and select terminal. By default, the working directory of the terminal instance is the home directory, however, the Jupyter notebook hub's root directory is under `SageMaker`. Enter the appropriate directory and clone the repository as follows:

```
cd SageMaker
git clone https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment.git
exit
```

After you have finished, close the terminal window.

Your notebook instance is now set up and ready to be used!
