Mini-Project: Building Your First Model
---

[Watch Video]

Now that you've seen an example of how to use SageMaker, it's your turn to try it out!

If you look at the deployment [Gitub repository](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment), inside of the `Mini-Projects` folder is a notebook called I`MDB Sentiment Analysis - XGBoost (Batch Transform).ipynb`. Inside of the notebook are some tasks for you to complete.

As you progress through the notebook you will construct an XGBoost model that tries to determine the sentiment, positive or negative, of a movie review using the [IMDB Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). Moving forward, most of the mini-projects that you will complete throughout this module will use the IMDB dataset.

**Note**: For the most part, creating this XGBoost model is pretty similar to the Boston Housing example that we just looked at so you can look there if you get stuck. In addition, a solution has been provided and in the next video we will go over my solution to this notebook.
