Format Data & Train the `LinearLearner`
---

**Train your Estimator**

After defining a model, you can format your training data and call .fit() to train the `LinearLearner`.

In the notebook, these exercises look as follows:

**EXERCISE: Convert data into a RecordSet format**

Prepare the data for a built-in model by converting the train features and labels into numpy array's of float values. Then you can use the record_set function to format the data as a RecordSet and prepare it for training!

```
# create RecordSet of training data
formatted_train_data = None
```

**EXERCISE: Train the Estimator**
After instantiating your estimator, train it with a call to .fit(), passing in the formatted training data.

```
%%time
# train the estimator on formatted training data
```

* first convert data into numpy float type `astype('float32')`
* then use `record_set()` method to convert them into record_set type.
* you can go back to sagemaker to check the training jobs status
* you can also go to cloud watch - log to check the details of the training performance, such as metrics.
