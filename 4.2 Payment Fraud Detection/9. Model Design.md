## Model Design

Now that you've seen how to tune and balance a LinearLearner. Create, train and deploy your own model. This exercise is meant to be more open-ended, so that you get practice with the steps involved in designing a model and deploying it.

### EXERCISE: Train and deploy a LinearLearner with appropriate hyperparameters, according to the given scenario

**Scenario:**
* A bank has asked you to build a model that optimizes for a good user experience; users should only ever have up to about 15% of their valid transactions flagged as fraudulent.

This requires that you make a design decision: Given the above scenario, what metric (and value) should you aim for during training?

You may assume that performance on a training set will be within about 5-10% of the performance on a test set. For example, if you get 80% on a training set, you can assume that you'll get between about 70-90% accuracy on a test set.

Your final model should account for class imbalance and be appropriately tuned.

**Final Cleanup!**

After completing these tasks, double check that you have deleted all your endpoints, and associated files. I'd also suggest manually deleting your S3 bucket, models, and endpoint configurations directly from your AWS console. You can find thorough cleanup instructions, in the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ex1-cleanup.html).
