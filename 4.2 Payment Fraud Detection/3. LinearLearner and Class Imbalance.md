LinearLearner & Class Imbalance

**Instantiate a LinearLearner**

Now that you've uploaded your training data, it's time to define and train a model! In the main exercise notebook, you'll define and train the SageMaker, built-in algorithm, LinearLearner.

**EXERCISE: Create a LinearLearner Estimator**

You've had some practice instantiating built-in models in SageMaker. All estimators require some constructor arguments to be passed in.

> See if you can complete this task, instantiating a LinearLearner estimator, using only the[ LinearLearner documentation](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/linear_learner.html) as a resource.

You'll find that this estimator takes in a lot of arguments, but not all are required. My suggestion is to start with a simple model, and utilize default values where applicable. Later, we will discuss some specific hyperparameters and their use cases.

**Instance Types**

It is suggested that you use instances that are available in the free tier of usage: 'ml.c4.xlarge' for training and 'ml.t2.medium' for deployment.

Here is what the exercise code looks like in the main notebook:

```
# import LinearLearner
from sagemaker import LinearLearner

# instantiate LinearLearner
```

Try to complete this code on your own, and I'll go over one possible solution, next!
