Optimizing according to a specific metric is called **model tuning**, and SageMaker provides a number of ways to automatically tune a model.


### Create a LinearLearner and tune for higher precision

**Scenario:**
* A bank has asked you to build a model that detects cases of fraud with an accuracy of about 85%.

In this case, we want to build a model that has as many true positives and as few false negatives, as possible. This corresponds to a model with a high **recall**: true positives / (true positives + false negatives).

To aim for a specific metric, LinearLearner offers the hyperparameter `binary_classifier_model_selection_criteria`, which is the model evaluation criteria for the training dataset. A reference to this parameter is in [LinearLearner's documentation](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/linear_learner.html#sagemaker.LinearLearner). We'll also have to further specify the exact value we want to aim for; read more about the details of the parameters, [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ll_hyperparameters.html).

I will assume that performance on a training set will be within about 5% of the performance on a test set. So, for a recall of about 85%, I'll aim for a bit higher, 90%.
