Now that you've seen an example of how to use SageMaker to tune a model, it's your turn to try it out!

Inside of the `Mini-Projects` folder is a notebook called `IMDB Sentiment Analysis - XGBoost (Hyperparameter Tuning).ipynb`. Inside of the notebook are some tasks for you to complete.

**Note**: To make things a little more interesting, there is a small error in the notebook. Try not to anticipate where the error is. Instead, just continue through the notebook as if nothing is wrong and when an error occurs, try to use CloudWatch to diagnose and fix it.
