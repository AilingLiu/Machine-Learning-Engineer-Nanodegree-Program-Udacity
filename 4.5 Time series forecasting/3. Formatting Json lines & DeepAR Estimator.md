### Instantiating a DeepAR Estimator

Some estimators have specific, SageMaker constructors, but not all. Instead, you can create a base Estimator and pass in the specific image (or container) that holds a specific model. The container for the DeepAR model can be gotten as follows:

```python
from sagemaker.amazon.amazon_estimator import get_image_uri

image_name = get_image_uri(boto3.Session().region_name, # get the region
                           'forecasting-deepar') # specify image
```

A generic Estimator will be defined by the usual constructor arguments and an `image_name`.

You can take a look at the [estimator source code](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/blob/master/src/sagemaker/estimator.py#L601) to view specifics.

If you complete this task, you can move on to setting DeepAR's model and training hyperparameters and call `.fit()` to start a training job! You're encouraged to keep going, deploying and evaluating the model on your owm; you are welcome to consult the solution videos to see if your answer matches mine.
