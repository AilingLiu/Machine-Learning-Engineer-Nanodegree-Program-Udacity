### Making Predictions

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKOYIfgjsq8)

Recall that we did not give our model any data about 2010, but let's see if it can predict the energy consumption given **no target**, only a known start date!

### Format a request for a "future" prediction

Create a formatted input to send to the deployed `predictor` passing in my usual parameters for "configuration". The "instances" will, in this case, just be one instance, defined by the following:
* **start**: The start time will be time stamp that you specify. To predict the first 30 days of 2010, start on Jan. 1st, '2010-01-01'.
* **target**: The target will be an empty list because this year has no, complete associated time series; we specifically withheld that information from our model, for testing purposes.
start_time, "target": []} # empty target

```python
# Starting my prediction at the beginning of 2010
start_date = '2010-01-01'
timestamp = '00:00:00'

# formatting start_date
start_time = start_date +' '+ timestamp

# format the request_data
# with "instances" and "configuration"
request_data = {"instances": [{"start": start_time, "target": []}],
                "configuration": {"num_samples": 50,
                                  "output_types": ["quantiles"],
                                  "quantiles": ['0.1', '0.5', '0.9']}
                }

# create JSON input
json_input = json.dumps(request_data).encode('utf-8')

print('Requesting prediction for '+start_time)
```
