### SageMaker's supervised learning model for time series forecasting: DeepAR

DeepAR utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN), which is designed to accept some sequence of data points as historical input and produce a predicted sequence of points. So, how does this model learn?

During training, you'll provide a training dataset (made of several time series) to a DeepAR estimator. The estimator looks at all the training time series and tries to identify similarities across them. It trains by randomly sampling training examples from the training time series.

* Each training example consists of a pair of adjacent **context** and **prediction** windows of fixed, predefined lengths.
  * The context_length parameter controls how far in the past the model can see.
  * The prediction_length parameter controls how far in the future predictions can be made.
  * You can find more details, in this documentation.
