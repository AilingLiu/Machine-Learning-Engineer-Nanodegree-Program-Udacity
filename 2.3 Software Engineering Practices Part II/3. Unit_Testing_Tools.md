Unit Testing Tools

To install `pytest`, run `pip install -U pytest` in your terminal. You can see more information on getting started [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html).

* Create a test file starting with `test_`

* Define unit test functions that start with `test_` inside the test file

* Enter `pytest` into your terminal in the directory of your test file and it will detect these tests for you!

`test_` is the default - if you wish to change this, you can learn how to in this `pytest` [configuration](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/customize.html)

In the test output, periods represent successful unit tests and F's represent failed unit tests. Since all you see is what test functions failed, it's wise to have only one `assert` statement per test. Otherwise, you wouldn't know exactly how many tests failed, and which tests failed.

Your tests won't be stopped by failed `assert` statements, but it will stop if you have syntax errors.
