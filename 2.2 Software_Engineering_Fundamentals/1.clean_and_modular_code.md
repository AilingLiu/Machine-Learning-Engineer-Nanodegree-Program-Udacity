**PRODUCTION CODE:** software running on production servers to handle live users and data of the intended audience. Note this is different from production quality code, which describes code that meets expectations in reliability, efficiency, etc., for production. Ideally, all code in production meets these expectations, but this is not always the case.

**CLEAN**: readable, simple, and concise. A characteristic of production quality code that is crucial for collaboration and maintainability in software development.

**MODULAR**: logically broken up into functions and modules. Also an important characteristic of production quality code that makes your code more organized, efficient, and reusable.

**MODULE**: a file. Modules allow code to be reused by encapsulating them into files that can be imported into other files.
