* **DOCUMENTATION**: additional text or illustrated information that comes with or is embedded in the code of software.

* Helpful for clarifying complex parts of code, making your code easier to navigate, and quickly conveying how and why different components of your program are used.

* Several types of documentation can be added at different levels of your program:
  * In-line Comments - line level
  * Docstrings - module and function level
  * Project Documentation - project level
